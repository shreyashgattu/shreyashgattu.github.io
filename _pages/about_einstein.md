I am a Master's Student at Northwestern University...

<!-- I am a 2nd Year PhD Student at the University of Southern California advised by <a href="https://swabhs.com/">Prof. Swabha Swayamdipta</a> in the NLP department at the <a href="https://dill-lab.github.io/">DILL Lab</a>. 
My research interests lie in investigating societal biases in datasets, measuring the propagation of such biases learned by models in downstream tasks and reasoning about the broader implications of fairness in applications of NLP for social good.

 Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.vislang.ai/">Vision, Language and Learning Lab,</a>
working with <a href="https://www.vicenteordonez.com/">Prof. Vicente Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez - Rice Univ.</a> and <a href="https://tianlu-wang.github.io/">Tianlu Wang - Meta Research </a>  on exploring gender biases in Visual Recognition Models. I was also a member of the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab">Link Lab</a> under the mentorship of  <a href="https://www.madhurbehl.com/">Prof. Madhur Behl - Univ. of Virginia</a> where I researched methodologies for better traffic scene understanding that contribute to the safety of autonomous vehicles. In my internship at <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>, I developed a framework to identify biases in search and recommendation models and prototyped <i>Learning to Rank</i> models for video based search.

I graduated with my Master's in Computer Science from the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a> in December 2021. I received my Bachelor of Science at the University of Virginia in Computer Science as a Rodman Scholar. 
Here is a link to my <a href="Resume.pdf"> curriculum vitae</a>. -->
